QUAKE 2 MOD - README

This mod was an attempt to add features of CoD Zombies to Quake 2 - monsters spawning in waves, randomized gun loot box, item pickups. I also tried to change the Quake weapons to a different theme and have a "spawner entity" monsters would spawn from.

**IMPORTANT** This mod is intended to be playing in Deathmatch (multiplayer) mode, in The Edge map. To start the game, it's recommended you go forward and up the stairs to the first main "courtyard" of the map. (The circular arena with stairs all around)

DELIVERABLES AND HOW TO TEST THEM

-Shortcut that Auto-Launches your Mod: Create shortcut from Quake2.exe and edit properties- add +set game modq2 +set cheats 1 to the end of the target string.

-Mod in a Separate Folder: Create new folder where baseq2 is kept. Name it modq2. Make sure this mod's dll is in there.

-README file in GIT that explains HOWTO install and play / test your mod: You are reading it!

-UI updates reflecting your Personal Deliverables: In the bottom right of the screen, you can see what wave you are on.

-Help Screen to detail how to play your mod in game: Press **F1** to display the help screen.

-Monsters spawning in waves: Type **startzombies** into the console to start zombies mode. Monsters will spawn in waves every 30s.

-Randomized loot box (for guns): Type **randomgun** into the console to get a random gun.

-Replace Quake weapons with a different weapon theme: An attempt was made - you can use the **give all** command and test the small change I made to some weapons (BFG, hyperblaster, Railgun, blaster). You can try using typing **zoom** in with the railgun equipped to have a sorta scope. However I didn't get to every one. I tried to make them themed to specific Splatoon weapons (blaster, dualies, charger, etc.) but didn't have time.

-Item pickups (w/ theme? like potions, etc.): Incomplete.

-Spawner entity for monsters: Type **startzombies** into the console to start zombies mode. There is a barrel in the middle of the courtyard that is the spawner entity. Also it handles all the monster wave spawning things.
